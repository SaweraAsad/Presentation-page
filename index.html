   Cosmology is, field of study that brings together the natural sciences, particularly astronomy and physics,
    In a joint effort to understand the physical universe as a unified whole. The “observable universe” is
     The region of space that humans can actually or theoretically observe with the aid of technology. 
     It can be thought of as a bubble with Earth at its centre. It is differentiated from the entirety
      of the universe, which is the whole cosmic system of matter and energy,  including the human race. 
      Unlike the observable universe, the  universe is possibly infinite and without spatial edges.

   If the kingdom of the stars seems vast, the realm of the galaxies is larger still. 
   The nearest galaxies to the Milky Way system are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, two irregular 
   satellites of the Galaxy visible to the naked eye in the Southern Hemisphere. The Magellanic Clouds are
    relatively small (containing roughly 109 stars) compared to the Galaxy (with some 1011 stars)
and lie at a distance of about 200,000 light-years. The nearest large galaxy comparable to 
     the Galaxy is the Andromeda Galaxy (also called M31 because it was the 31st entry in a catalog of
      astronomical objects compiled by the French astronomer Charles Messier in 1781), and it lies at a 
      distance of about 2,000,000 light-years. The Magellanic Clouds, the Andromeda Galaxy, and the Milky
       The way the system is all part of an aggregation of two dozen or so neighbouring galaxies known as the Local 
       Group. The Galaxy and M31 are the largest members of this group.

    M THEORY

       "At first, there were six different approaches," said Duff. "And Witten showed us that they weren't really 
       Six different theories, but rather six different corners of a deeper, more profound theory that he called the M Theory."

       M Theory solved many problems, Duff added. It enabled physicists to perform more exact calculations and reconciled the String 
       Theory with Stephen Hawking's black hole formula and his theory that black holes 'leak' a form of thermal radiation that would 
       come to be known as "Hawking Radiation," evaporating as they do so.

       M Theory also introduced what Duff calls the holographic principle, which states that "the gravitational world in a certain " 
       number of dimensions can be described by a non-gravitational theory that lives on its boundary, which has one 
       dimensionless," said Duff, admitting that the claim, while rather "astonishing," seems to work.
